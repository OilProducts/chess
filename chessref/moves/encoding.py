"""AlphaZero-style move indexing utilities.

The move space follows the 8x8x73 layout popularised by AlphaZero:

* 56 queen-like ray moves (8 directions x up to 7 squares).
* 8 knight jumps.
* 9 pawn underpromotion moves (3 piece types x 3 directions).

Moves are indexed from the perspective of the side to move. When the board
turn is black we rotate the move by 180Â° (using :func:`chess.square_mirror`).
This keeps the encoding symmetric for both players and matches common
iterative-refinement setups.
